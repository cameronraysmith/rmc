An {\em initial object} in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is an object $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$ such that, for every object $X$ in $\mathcal{C}$, there is exactly one morphism $A \longrightarrow X$. A {\em terminal object} in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is an object $B$ in $\mathcal{C}$ such that, for every object $X$ in $\mathcal{C}$, there is exactly one morphism $X \longrightarrow B$. A {\em zero object} in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is an object $0$ that is both an initial object and a terminal object. All initial objects (respectively, terminal objects, and zero objects), if they exist, are isomorphic in $\mathcal{C}$.
