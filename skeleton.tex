\begin{abstract}
The abstract characterization of essential properties of biological systems is necessary in order to formalize corresponding essential features of evolutionary processes. Such a characterization supports recognition of patterns associated to the variety of particular ways in which biological systems may be realized. All such realizations, regardless of the degree of diversity exhibited in their structure, may then be related by the fact that they all instantiate a common functional form. Here we propose, in relation to previous work, such a characterization whose primary conceptual aspect is that of {\it functional closure}. In this framework any non-equilibrium system may be viewed as being supported by a material flux from which it extracts energy in the process of its self-organization, but a biological system is additionally considered to be required to achieve the capacity to generate all necessary transformations to render its temporally periodic structure stable. Only in the latter case will biological systems exhibit the dynamic fluctuations in their structure that we observe in the context of development and reproduction while maintaining a long-term stability that enables them to persist long enough to be observed on macroscopic time-scales. This scenario abstractly characterizes that which supports the existence of what we can observe of evolutionary history in addition to what we might be possible to observe in future experiments in artificial laboratory evolution.

\section{Introduction}

The current volume of biological data surpasses our present capacity to integrate and understand it at least in part because we have not produced a theoretical framework that supports the generation of important hypotheses in light of such data. The naturalist dream that highly values an extensive catalogue of biological diversity has reached molecular resolution and yet, aside from heuristics associated to evolutionary theory, we lack a fundamental theory in which to understand and interpret the relationships living systems exhibit that transcend levels of the biological hierarchy. Moreover, there is no proper language tailored to apprehend, communicate or abstractly settle an ensemble of biological problems that share a common structure. As the current paradigm, apparently organized around data gathering continues, its limitations have become increasingly apparent. If we continue to characterize our biosphere at the molecular level without a promising theoretical framework, we will remain lost in its vastness. What is worse, we could end up in biological Babel with no integrative perspective and thus no means of communication. Hence, from a purely pragmatic perspective, the scientific community in the domain of biology requires more investment in the project of unification of knowledge.

Category theory has provided a useful language in which to talk about and interrelate mathematical theories. In its beginnings, category theory was commonly referred to by mathematicians as {\it abstract nonsense}, but over the past sixty years the community has largely begun to embrace it even in an applied fashion in both physics and computer science. The fundamental organizational power of category theory resides in giving ontological status to processes or relationships over objects.

The substrate-enzyme-product abstraction from enzyme kinetics has been adopted to model genetic regulation and even intercellular interactions and other population-level processes. It appears that a common feature of models of biological systems, similarly to category theory, promotes placing transformation processes at least on equal footing with particular biomolecules. What is more is that the way in which information about biological systems has come to be described in terms of various types of networks is also amicable to a category theoretic treatment as a category can itself be viewed as a directed graph with some extra structure.

In this light and in this work we reevaluate a historical approach to characterize an important abstract property of biolgoical systems in terms of so-called {\it functional closure}. This feature appears to distinguish biological systems to some extent, but future technological advances, if they have not already, may lead this distinction to break down. Nevertheless, it will still be possible to view existing biological systems as sharing the particular feature and the many detailed aspects of their structure as representing variations on this relatively simple underlying theme.

\section{Attempting to define living systems}

One of the most controversial yet fundamental abstractions that any biological frontier field has to deal with is the selection of the set of properties that characterize uniquely a living system. The majority of the definitions of life focus on the ability to self-sustain, reproduce and evolve autonomously, tying the system to the evolutionary theory. However, not all properties appear simultaneously in all biological systems and \textit{parasitic} organisms can be found for some of the properties described. Furthermore, the lack of other biospheres to compare with, generates a problem regarding the evaluation of our biota historical component. We can classify the properties chosen to define life in two broad groups; evolutionary properties such as reproduction and evolvavility or thermodynamic properties such as autopoiesis and metabolic transformation. The first two are related to the biological level laws while the thermodynamic considerations describe how these higher level properties are sustained by lower level dynamics. The element left intentionally outside of this discussion is the environment in which the living system is defined, or more concretely, the boundary of our so called living system. 

A common argument against some definitions of life is the weakening of this boundary as the environment gets more complex. One might argue that the autonomy of some systems is dependent on the environmental complexity and thus the definition of living system is highly context dependent. However, the definition of autonomy can be recovered if material and functional aspects are distinguished. Ironically, the Aristotelian paradigm that was abandoned with the advent of modern science, can shed some light to this issue. The recovery of the distinction between material and formal cause was crucial for the development of the concept of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(mathematics)}{closure} applied to efficient causality in autonomous living systems. By differentiating between material and efficient cause, Rosen kept the nature of object and refined the concept of autopoiesis by Maturana and Varela. Invoking this characteristic closure versus a material closure allows us to perfectly solve the environmental complexity problem. 

A more structural definition of life regarding the properties captured by the functions of the system elements, can be used to demarcate four different kinds of \textit{bioid entities} that would be the object of the study of evolutionary biology. So, as functional closure guarantees autopoiesis and thus replication, we will consider as well evolvavility closure as the second property that might define, at the biological, level an autonomous living system. It must be clarified, however what we understand by evolvability closure. 

As a mere instance to show the power of category theory organizing ideas, it could be argued that a reasoning analogous to metabolic closure can be placed upon the evolvability of the system. As considered with autopoiesis and, on particular terms, with replication, the evolvability of an autonomous biological system can be thought as closed to its efficient causation. It is important to note here that we are referring to the biological system capacity or potential to evolve no the particular evolutionary trajectory given a set of environmental conditions. 

Evolution requires the production of an offspring with certain error or variability, hence an evolvable system has to comprise both capabilities in order to persist in time.  This variability has to be inherited. Previously it has been shown that we can recover reproduction as a particular case of autopoiesis thus we will just consider variability as the property that has to be closed to efficient causation so as to to consider evolutionary closure. In order to achieve a proper conceptualization, we need to define what we understand by this closure to the inheritance of variants. 


Let us take the previously autonomous system considered, the prion which is autonomously replicating....is it autonomously evolving? not unless the prion can produce a variable offspring

\section{Basic concepts of category theory}

It is not the objective of this work to give a detailed and more formal exposition of category theory but to provide the necessary perspective in order to understand the present text. As a reference in category theory the reader is advised to consult ...

A {\it category} $\mathcal{C}$ is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A set of objects $\Ob(\mathcal{C})$.
\item For each pair $x, y \in \Ob(\mathcal{C})$ a set of morphisms
$\Mor_\mathcal{C}(x, y)$.
\item For each triple $x, y, z\in \Ob(\mathcal{C})$ a composition
map $ \Mor_\mathcal{C}(y, z) \times \Mor_\mathcal{C}(x, y)
\to \Mor_\mathcal{C}(x, z) $, denoted $(\phi, \psi) \mapsto
\phi \circ \psi$.
\end{enumerate}
Such that these constraints are satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For every element $x\in \Ob(\mathcal{C})$ there exists a
morphism $\text{id}_x\in \Mor_\mathcal{C}(x, x)$ such that
$\text{id}_x \circ \phi = \phi$ and $\psi \circ \text{id}_x = \psi $.
\item Composition is associative, i.e., $(\phi \circ \psi) \circ \chi =
\phi \circ ( \psi \circ \chi)$.
\end{enumerate}

A {\it functor} $F : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$
between two categories $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}$ is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A map $F : \Ob(\mathcal{A}) \to \Ob(\mathcal{B})$.
\item For every $x, y \in \Ob(\mathcal{A})$ a map
$F : \Mor_\mathcal{A}(x, y) \to \Mor_\mathcal{B}(F(x), F(y))$,
denoted $\phi \mapsto F(\phi)$.
\end{enumerate}
These data should be compatible with composition and identity morphisms
in the following manner: $F(\phi \circ \psi) =
F(\phi) \circ F(\psi)$ for a composable pair $(\phi, \psi)$ of
morphisms of $\mathcal{A}$ and $F(\text{id}_x) = \text{id}_{F(x)}$.

Let $x, y\in \Ob(\mathcal{C})$,
A {\it product} of $x$ and $y$ is
an object $x \times y \in \Ob(\mathcal{C})$
together with morphisms
$p\in \Mor_{\mathcal C}(x \times y, x)$ and
$q\in\Mor_{\mathcal C}(x \times y, y)$ such
that the following universal property holds: for
any $w\in \Ob(\mathcal{C})$ and morphisms
$\alpha \in \Mor_{\mathcal C}(w, x)$ and
$\beta \in \Mor_\mathcal{C}(w, y)$
there is a unique
$\gamma\in \Mor_{\mathcal C}(w, x \times y)$ making
the diagram
$$

\label{definition-has-products-of-pairs}

We say the category $\mathcal{C}$ {\it has products of pairs
of objects} if a product $x \times y$
exists for any $x, y \in \Ob(\mathcal{C})$.

}

Let $\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{D}$ be categories.
Let $F : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ and
$G : \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{C}$ be functors.
We say that $F$ is a {\it left adjoint} of $G$ or that
$G$ is a {\it right adjoint} to $F$, written $F \dashv G$, if there are bijections

$$
\phi_{c,d}:\Mor_\mathcal{D}(Fc, d)
\simeq
\Mor_\mathcal{C}(c, Gd)
$$

functorial in $c \in \Ob(\mathcal{C})$, and
$d \in \Ob(\mathcal{D})$.

Morphisms that are associated with each other according to the bijections of an adjunction are called {\it adjoint transposes} of one another. 

There is a correspondence

\abovedisplayskip=0pt
\begin{align*}
g &: Fc \rightarrow d, \,\, g \in \Mor(\mathcal{D})\\
g^* &: c \rightarrow Gd, \,\, g^* \in \Mor(\mathcal{C})
\end{align*}

given by $\phi_{c,d}(g) = g^*$. 
Similarly for 

\begin{align*}
f &: c \rightarrow Gd, \,\, f \in \Mor(\mathcal{C})\\
f^* &: Fc \rightarrow d, \,\, f^* \in \Mor(\mathcal{D}) 
\end{align*}

given by $\phi_{c,d}^{-1}(f) = f^*$. 
We see then that $g^* = f$ and $f^* = g$.

Consider the identity morphism $1_{Fc} \in \Mor_{\mathcal{D}}(Fc,Fc)$. The adjoint transpose of $1_{Fc}$ is the {\it unit} morphism at $c$

$$
\phi_{c,Fc}(1_{Fc})=1_{Fc}^*=\eta_c: c \rightarrow GFc
$$

where $\eta_c \in \Mor_{\mathcal{C}}(c,GFc)$, which, when taken to be natural in $c \in \Ob(\mathcal{C})$, gives the natural transformation

$$
\eta : 1_{\mathcal{C}} \Rightarrow GF
$$

Consider the identity morphism $1_{Gd} \in \Mor_{\mathcal{C}}(Gd,Gd)$. The adjoint transpose of $1_{Gd}$ is the {\it counit} morphism at $d$

$$
\phi_{Gd,d}^{-1}(1_{Gd})=1_{Gd}^*=\epsilon_d: FGd \rightarrow d
$$

where $\epsilon_d \in \Mor_{\mathcal{D}}(d,FGd)$, which, when natural in $d$, gives the natural transformation

$$
\epsilon: FG \Rightarrow 1_{\mathcal{D}}
$$

We can then give an alternative definition of adjoint functors in terms of the unit natural transformation (dually the counit natural transformation) as
\begin{align*}
F & \colon \mathcal{C} \rightleftarrows \mathcal{D} \colon G\\
\eta & \colon 1_{\mathcal{C}} \rightarrow GF
\end{align*}
where for any $c \in \Ob (\mathcal{C})$, $d \in \Ob (\mathcal{D})$, and $f \colon c \rightarrow Gd \in \Mor(\mathcal{C})$ there exists a unique $g \colon Fc \rightarrow d \in \Mor(\mathcal{D})$ such that $f = Gg \circ \eta_c$				

		$$
					\xymatrix{
					c \ar[r]^{\eta_c} \ar[dr]_{f} & G F c \ar[d]^{G g} & F c \ar@{.>}[d]^{g}\\
					& G d & d}
		$$
	
		$$
			\frac{c \longrightarrow Gd}{Fc \longrightarrow d}
		$$
	
We can then give an alternative definition of adjoint functors in terms of the counit natural transformation (dually the unit natural transformation) as
$$
F \colon \mathcal{C} \rightleftarrows \mathcal{D} \colon G
$$
$$
\epsilon \colon FG \rightarrow 1_{\mathcal{C}}
$$
where for any $c \in \Ob (\mathcal{C})$, $d \in \Ob (\mathcal{D})$, and $g \colon Fc \rightarrow d \in \Mor(\mathcal{D})$ there exists a unique $f \colon c \rightarrow Gd \in \Mor(\mathcal{C})$ such that $g = \epsilon_D \circ Ff$	

$$
			\xymatrix{
			& F c \ar[d]^{F f} \ar[dl]_{g} & c \ar@{.>}[d]^{f}\\
			d & F G d \ar[l]^{\epsilon_d} & G d}
$$

		$$
			\frac{Fc \longrightarrow d}{c \longrightarrow Gd}
		$$
		
An adjunction relevant to our discussion is the one existing between the product functor of a category into itself and the exponentiation functor of a category into itself. The hom-tensor adjunction, denoted $\times \dashv Hom$ is defined as:
		
		\begin{align*}
- \times Z: \mathcal{C} & \rightleftarrows \mathcal{C}: (-)^Z\\
\Mor_{\mathcal{C}}(X \times Z, Y) & \cong  \Mor_{\mathcal{C}}(X, Y^Z)
\end{align*}

The bijection mediated by the evaluation map can be specified by the following diagram:

			$$
			\xymatrix{
			& X \times Z \ar[d]^{\bar{f} \times 1_Z} \ar[dl]_{f} & X \ar@{.>}[d]^{\bar{f}}\\
			Y & Y^Z \times Z \ar[l]^{\epsilon_Y} & Y^Z}
			$$

		$$
			\frac{X \times Z \longrightarrow Y}{X \longrightarrow Y^Z}
		$$
		
The counit of the adjunction is the evaluation map:

		$$
			\epsilon_Y = ev_Y \colon Y^Z \times Z \longrightarrow Y
		$$
	
	
\section{Functional closure as an invariant property of biological systems}

In this section, we will make a clear exposition of the categorical modelling relationship of a functionally closed living system. We will review succinctly Rosen's M,R-systems and hopefully go beyond concreting a categorical model of a living system inspired in our biosphere.

The first thing we will use in order to build a categorical representation of a living system is its property as a transforming or metabolic entity. Departing from this consideration, a metabolic mapping in a living system $\mathcal{L}$ can be thought as a morphism between two objects of the \textbf{category} $\mathcal{L}$ such that:

\begin{center}
	$\xymatrix@1{
	A\ar[r]^-{f} & B
	}$

\end{center}

As a first approximation, we can think of both objects as sets, where $A$ represents the input metabolites and $B$  products of metabolic transformations. This is a zero order abstraction of a living system that could be further developed in the light of considering those sets as graphs. We can define all \textbf{metabolisms} together as the set of all the different morphisms between these objects referred to as $Hom(A,B)$ or $B^A$.

The finite nature of living systems, imposes several constrains regarding the reposition or repair of the components that constitute it. So, as metabolic enzymes decay they must be regenerated, from the metabolic products, or the system comprised of them will disintegrate. Besides, environmental fluctuations in $A$ have to be corrected by the differential availability and performance of the metabolic function. Hence, there must be a collection of morphisms from $B$ to $Hom(A,B)$ which can be identified with a \textbf{repair} system such that:


\begin{center}
	$
	\xymatrix@1{
	A\ar[r]^f &B\ar[r]^-g & B^A}
	$
\end{center}


 The repair system itself or $g \in B^{A^B}$ also has a finite lifetime and needs to be regenerated by some other system.
 \begin{align*}
R: B^A & \longrightarrow B^{A^B}\\
f & \longmapsto R(f)
\end{align*}	

This argument appears to fall into infinite regress (\textbf{Figure 1}), but a detailed analysis shows that a \textbf{replication} function that closes the system to efficient causation is implicit in this categorical representation.

\begin{figure}
\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.45\columnwidth]{fig/mrcatinf.pdf}
\caption{Diagram showing the infinite stack of morphisms that apparently, would be needed to close the category}
\label{fig:hom}
\end{figure}

Now, let us consider that the category $\mathcal{L}$ is concrete and has products. In order for  $\mathcal{L}$  to be functionally closed every morphism must be represented by or be in turn an object of the category. As we have seen in the introductory section, the set of $Hom(A,B)$ between two objects in the category can be represented by the exponential object $B^A$. These exponential objects come together with special evaluation mappings such that:

\begin{align*}
e_f : B^A \times A &\longrightarrow B\\
(f,a) & \longmapsto f(a)
\end{align*}

For the metabolic morphisms.	
	
\begin{align*}
			e_g: B^{A^B} \times B &\longrightarrow B^A\\
	    			            (g,b) & \longmapsto    g(b)
			\end{align*}		
For the repair system.

 We can take the system as described and develop all the exponentiations of its maps and represent all the evaluation functions of its exponential objects:		

$$
			\xymatrix{
			 ... & ... & ... \\
			  B^{A^{B^A}} \times A \ar[r]_-{\epsilon} \ar[u]^-{..^A} & B^{A^B} \ar[u]^-{..} & B^{A^{B^B}} \times B\ar[l]^-{\epsilon}\ar[u]^-{..^B} \\
			 B^{A^A} \times A \ar[r]_-{\epsilon} \ar[u]^-{r^A} & B^A \ar[u]^-{r} & B^{A^B} \times B\ar[l]^-{\epsilon}\ar[u]^-{r^B} \\
			B^A \times A \ar[r]_-{\epsilon} \ar[u]^-{g^A} & B \ar[u]^-{g} & B^B \times B\ar[l]^-{\epsilon}\ar[u]^-{g^B} \\
			A^A \times A \ar[r]_-{\epsilon} \ar[u]^-{f^A} & 
			A\ar[u]^-{f} & A^B\times B\ar[l]^-{\epsilon}\ar[u]^-{f^B} }
			$$

As it can be observed, once you reach the second level of exponentiation, the system is already closed, and the higher level exponential objects can be reduced to lower level morphisms. The very same feature can be explained in terms of the $\times \dashv Hom$ adjunction (see the appendix). 

\begin{align*}
- \times A: \mathcal{C} & \rightleftarrows \mathcal{C}: (-)^A
\end{align*}
For any $B \in Obj(\mathcal{L})$ there is a bijection:
\begin{align*}
\Mor_{\mathcal{C}}(B \times A, B) & \cong  \Mor_{\mathcal{C}}(B, B^A)
\end{align*}
		$$
			\frac{B \times A \longrightarrow B}{B \longrightarrow B^A}
		$$
For the case of $B$ we obtain the \textbf{repair} map as the exponential transpose of the following diagram:

			$$
			\xymatrix{
			& B \times A \ar[d]^{g \times 1_A} \ar[dl]_{\bar{g}} & B \ar@{.>}[d]^{g}\\
			B & B^A \times A \ar[l]^{\epsilon_B} & B^A}
			$$
	
Where the counit is the evaluation map
		$$
			\epsilon_B = ev_B \colon B^A \times A \longrightarrow B
		$$
In the same way, we can specify the adjunction on $B^A$:
\begin{align*}
\Mor_{\mathcal{C}}(B^A \times A, B) & \cong  \Mor_{\mathcal{C}}(B^A, B^{A})
\end{align*}
	$$
			\frac{B^A \times A \longrightarrow B}{B^A \longrightarrow B^{A}}
		$$
				$$
			\xymatrix{
			& B^A \times A \ar[d]^{1_{B^A} \times 1_A} \ar[dl]_{\overline{1_{B^A}}} & B^A \ar@{.>}[d]^{1_{B^A}}\\
			B & B^A \times A \ar[l]^-{\overline{1_{B^A}}} & B^A}
			$$

If we repeat the process exponentiating $B^A$ by $B$, the \textbf{replication} map is obtained:	
\begin{align*}
- \times B: \mathcal{C} & \rightleftarrows \mathcal{C}: (-)^B\\
\Mor_{\mathcal{C}}(B^A \times B, B^A) & \cong  \Mor_{\mathcal{C}}(B^A, B^{A^B})
\end{align*}
	$$
			\frac{B^A \times B \longrightarrow B^A}{B^A \longrightarrow B^{A^B}}
		$$
			$$ \xymatrix{
			& B^A \times B \ar[d]^-{h \times 1_B} \ar[dl]_{\bar{h}} & B^A \ar@{.>}[d]^-{h}\\
			B^A & B^{A^B} \times B \ar[l]^{\epsilon_{B^A}} & B^{A^B}}
			$$
		
Taking as object $B^{A^B}$:

\begin{align*}
- \times B: \mathcal{C} & \rightleftarrows \mathcal{C}: (-)^B\\
\Mor_{\mathcal{C}}(B^{A^B} \times B, B^A) & \cong  \Mor_{\mathcal{C}}(B^{A^B}, B^{A^B})
\end{align*}

		$$
			\frac{B^{A^B} \times B \longrightarrow B^A}{B^{A^B} \longrightarrow B^{A^B}}
		$$

			$$
			\xymatrix{
			& B^{A^B} \times B \ar[d]^{1_{B^{A^B}} \times 1_B} \ar[dl]_{\overline{1_{B^{A^B}}}} & B^{A^B} \ar@{.>}[d]^{1_{B^{A^B}}}\\
			B^A & B^{A^B} \times B \ar[l]^-{\overline{1_{B^{A^B}}}} & B^{A^B}}
			$$
Recapitulating, we can get closure at the first level by the following set of bijections:
				\begin{prooftree}
				\AxiomC{$B^A \times A \longrightarrow B$}
				\UnaryInfC{$B^A \longrightarrow B^A$}
				\UnaryInfC{$1 \longrightarrow B^A \longrightarrow B^A$}							\UnaryInfC{$1 \times A \longrightarrow B \longrightarrow B^A$}
				\UnaryInfC{$A \longrightarrow B \longrightarrow B^A$}
				\UnaryInfC{$A \longrightarrow B^A$}
				\end{prooftree}
						
However, if we want to place the biological metaphor in the proper place, we can achive the same at the second level and thus obtain a closed system such as the M,R-System:
			
\begin{prooftree}
				\AxiomC{$B^{A^B} \times B \longrightarrow B^A$}
				\UnaryInfC{$B^{A^B} \longrightarrow B^{A^B}$}
				\UnaryInfC{$1 \longrightarrow B^{A^B} \longrightarrow B^{A^B}$}
				\UnaryInfC{$1 \times B \longrightarrow B^A \longrightarrow B^{A^B}$}
				\UnaryInfC{$B \longrightarrow B^A \longrightarrow B^{A^B}$}
				\UnaryInfC{$B \longrightarrow B^{A^B}$}
				\end{prooftree}

Closing the system by:

\begin{align*}
- \times B: \mathcal{C} & \rightleftarrows \mathcal{C}: (-)^B\\
\Mor_{\mathcal{C}}(B^{A^B} \times B, B^{A^B}) & \cong  \Mor_{\mathcal{C}}(B^{A^B}, B^{A^{B^B}})
\end{align*}

			$$
			\xymatrix{
			& B^{A^B} \times B \ar[d]^-{i \times 1_B} \ar[dl]_{\bar{i}} & B^{A^B} \ar@{.>}[d]^-{i}\\
			B^{A^B} & B^{A^{B^B}} \times B \ar[l]^{\epsilon} & B^{A^{B^B}}
			}
			$$
		$$
			\frac{B^{A^B} \times B \longrightarrow B^{A^B}}{B^{A^B} \longrightarrow B^{A^{B^B}}}
		$$
		the counit is the evaluation map
		$$
			\epsilon = ev_{B^{A^B}} \colon B^{A^{B^B}} \times B \longrightarrow B^{A^B}
		$$
