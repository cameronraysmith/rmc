\section*{Introduction}
The capacities have been demonstrated to chemically synthesize and transplant genomes to alter organismal identity \todo{insert reference to Smith/Venter work on M. genitalium} and to execute simulations of the life cycle of a single-celled organism \todo{insert reference to Karr/Covert whole-cell model} by collecting measurements of a large number of parameter values conveying detailed information about its underlying processes and integrating them into presumably analogous coupled algorithmic processes. These capacities and the technologies that may result from them add to the mounting pressure underlying the very existence of the field of systems biology to ask, in an effort to synthesize knowledge from an enormous number of empirical investigations, whether or not we can abstract properties that are necessary, and perhaps sufficient, for determining a process capable of generating organisms \emph{de novo}. Answering questions like this one are crucial for clarifying hypotheses germane to understanding what is required in order to explain the origin and distinguishing characteristics of life and thus the origin and nature of evolutionary processes.

Very few biologists or other scientists dispute that evolution is the most fundamental organizing concept in biology. In this light, it seems somewhat surprising that not even more effort than has already been exerted is invested in clarifying and formalizing increasingly detailed conceptions of its origins and operation. In order to understand biological systems, it will be necessary to address the question: What are the necessary enabling conditions that make biological evolution possible? The synthesis of some potential answers to this question may clarify a path toward defining a sufficient collection of preconditions for evolutionary processes to take flight.

Here we argue that one such necessary precondition for evolution, which has been identified before as a ``defining characteristic of life''\todo{cite Rosen's original work}, is what we refer to as \emph{functional closure}. In order to define this term and its context, we begin with a diagrammatic model of a prototypical biochemical reaction network that has been claimed to possess this property. We then ask: Is there a formal language capable of expressing this property? A brief detour is necessary to motivate this question. In computer science, there is a property of languages called \emph{expressive power} that is used both heuristically and formally to rank order models of computation, programming languages, and their associated logics with respect to one another and with respect to so-called \emph{natural language}. Roughly speaking, an increased level of expressive power of a language correlates with its ability to express more complex or sophisticated ideas. One might ask why it is not always desirable to work within the extant language containing the highest possible expressive power. One reason to consider less expressive languages at all is that important questions about them can be answered algorithmically with appropriate computer hardware and software in a practical amount of time and memory, whereas the same questions posed of languages with more expressive power are known not to be able to be answered by such means\todo{cite a review and/or text containing relevant results in computational complexity and computability theory}. Thus, identifying a minimal language capable of expressing the necessary conditions for the origin of evolutionary processes is directly germane to the continuing development of exquisitely detailed models of whole cells as they are refined, unfold and are embedded into equally detailed multi-level models of populations, communities, and ecosystems.

In this light, we can refine the question, "Is there a formal language capable of expressing the functional closure property?" by adjoining the follow-up question, "If so, among those that are, which is the language of minimal expressive power?" We begin to address the first question taking an historically motivated approach \todo{cite Rosen's original work and perhaps Letelier et al, 2006} by attempting to interpret this diagram in terms of an abstract algebraic language (category theory). Unfortunately, the prototypical diagram violates a fundamental assumption of this language precisely because the diagram expresses the functional closure property. This diagram, and indeed the functional closure property in general, can be interpreted in terms of a standard model of computation called (untyped or type-free) lambda calculus. Via this conceptual route, we find that the interpretation of functional closure in terms of category theory can be recovered, albeit it in a form that looks quite different, via one typical category theoretic semantics for the untyped lambda calculus.

Although the untyped lambda calculus and its associated category theoretic semantics are capable of expressing the functional closure property, this method has at least two problems. One is that the untyped lambda calculus is a relatively highly expressive language capable of implementing general recursion. The second is that the untyped lambda calculus is capable of expressing functional closure in a trivial way via something as simple as an identity function. A simple solution might seem to pass to the simply typed lambda calculus, of which the untyped lambda calculus has been argued to be a special case. However, as a result of the analogous category theoretic semantics for the simply typed lambda calculus, doing so brings us back to the original category theoretic interpretation of the diagram expressing the functional closure property that we demonstrated to be in type-theoretic error.

This circularity seems to suggest that in order to address the second question regarding minimal expressive power necessary to express functional closure it may be necessary to take into account expressions of functional closure that may be possible to construct in various extensions of the simply typed lambda calculus (some of these may be found on the seven additional vertices of Barendregt's lambda cube\todo{if this is not removed, cite Barendregt's lambda calculus text}). We discuss these issues with respect to the goal of identifying a language of minimal expressive power capable of representing the functional closure property or, what may be relevant in light of the fact that the functional closure property in its present formulation may be too strong and require weakening of some form, approximations thereof.

\label{fig:cellprocess}
\end{figure}
Many salient features of biological organization at the level of a simple parasitic single-celled organism have recently been encapsulated in a unified computational model of the life-cycle of such a cell. In particular, this model tracks 16 important cell-level variables that each depend on a specified subset of 28 cellular processes. Figure~\ref{fig:cellprocess} shows a schematic depicting the interrelationships between these processes specified in the context of this model.

\label{fig:ctacyc}
\end{figure}
From an energetic, and thus physical, perspective, metabolic processes like the citric acid cycle (see Figure \ref{fig:ctacyc} \todo{insert adaptation reference to Karr/Covert in legend}) are certainly fundamental to the existence and persistence of all evolvable systems. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cellprocess}, metabolic processes form the connection between the dual components induced by considering cells as systems in the first place: the internal and the external environment. Moreover, it has been argued that metabolic processes form the basis or atomic level in a hierarchy of cellular processes. From this point of view, the complex regulatory networks involving small molecules, DNA, proteins and other molecular types are viewed as subservient to and layered atop core metabolic processes. Moreover, metabolic processes may be viewed as causally prior to the origin of evolution\todo{cite references discussing the metabolism-first view of the origin of life}.

These facts regarding the fundamental nature motivate the ability to attempt to model metabolism abstractly in attempts to characterize and parse its essential properties from those that may be no more than historical contingency. There are several existing formalisms that exist for constructing dynamical models of metabolic processes. However, these do not attempt to explain how metabolic processes originated or how they are maintained by complex networks of molecular interactions that are not themselves considered only as indirectly related to metabolic processes.

Robert Rosen suggested a formalism for metabolic networks that does attempt to abstractly incorporate the interrelationships between metabolic networks and the other regulatory networks involving interactions among DNA, RNA, and proteins\todo{citations to Rosen's original work on (M,R)-systems}. At the heart of this formalism lies the conceptual conviction that, in some sense, metabolic processes must be able to intrinsically construct at least some of their own causal antecedents. The justification for stating ``at least some of'' as opposed to all is on the basis of taking the distinction between metabolic substrate and enzyme very seriously.

In the context of a network of biochemical reactions, the heuristic distinction between metabolic substrates and enzymes is made on the basis of knowledge about the input and output of any given biochemical reaction. Those inputs that emerge from a biochemical reaction with relatively little to no change in their structure are considered to be enzymes and those whose structure is altered are considered to be substrates whose altered forms are referred to as products. 

A situation analogous to the enzyme-substrate-product abstraction\todo{this terminology is used if nowhere else in the main BioPAX publication} is formalized in a fundamental manner in type theory, category theory and the relationship between them. This distinction was originally formalized in Russell and Whitehead's type theory as a means of circumventing the self-referential Russell's (also known as Barber's) paradox of set theory in which one can not determine internal to the language of set theory whether a set of all sets that contain themselves contains itself or not\todo{cite Russell and Whitehead or perhaps a more modern source like John L Bell's Types, Sets and Categories}. In type theory a hierarchy is introduced that is analogous to the distinction fundamental to the definition of a category in category theory between objects (which are like substrates and products in terms of metabolic networks) and morphisms (which play the role of enzymes).
