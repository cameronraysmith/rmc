abstract = {The world is increasingly populated with interactive agents distributed in space, real or abstract. These agents can be artificial, as in computing systems that manage and monitor traffic or health; or they can be natural, e.g. communicating humans, or biological cells. It is important to be able to model networks of agents in order to understand and optimize their behavior. Robin Milner describes in this book just such a model, by presenting a unified and rigorous structural theory, based on bigraphs, for systems of interacting agents. This theory is a bridge between the existing theories of concurrent processes and the aspirations for ubiquitous systems, whose enormous size challenges our understanding. The book is self-contained mathematically and is designed to be learned from: examples and exercises abound, solutions for the latter are provided.},

@phdthesis{Rorty1956,
abstract = {This dissertation is an historical study of the use of the concept of pot­entiality, and related modal concepts, in philosophical systems. It deals with (1) the use of the concept of potentiality by Aristotle; (2) the rejec­tion of this concept by the seventeenth-century rationalists; (3 ) the difficulties concerning- the analysis of modal terms encountered by contemporary logical empiricists. Chapters I and II argue that, within the context of Aristotle's metaphysi­cal and epistemological assumptions, the notion of potentiality can be given an unambiguous status and a clear meaning. In particular, it is argued that an Aristotelian is simply a substance considered in relation to another substance, and that any Interpretation of £uVa.pbS as a half-way house between being and non-being is misguided. Chapter III argues that Aristotle's conceptual framework makes impossible an account of the relevance of "accidental" change to "substantial" change, and that Aristotle's solution of the problem of change in terns of the distinction between potency and act, while valid in certain areas, is therefore ultimately unsatisfactory. Chapter IV describes the downfall of the Aristotelian interpretation of nature in terms of things and their natures, and its replacement by the Cartesian interpretation in terms of events and (mathematically formulable) laws. It shows how this change renders the concept of potentiality nuga­tory, but argues that Cartesianism's interpretation of potentiality, possibility and contingency in terms of human fallibility creates an analogue of Aristotle's problem of the possibility of change: the problem of the possibility of error. Chapters V and VI argue that the two principal solu­tions to the problem of error which can be given within the framework of assumptions set by Cartesian rationalism (the solutions proposed by Spinoza and Leibniz) are equally inadequate. Chapter VII maintains that dispositional predicates, subjunctive condi­tionals, and "lawlike" sentences cannot be successfully analyzed by means of an extensional language. It shows how this failure of Humean empiri­cism to replicate the status of modalities is analogous to previous treat­ments of modality, and argues that there is an important sense in which potentiality, error, and intentionality are three names for the same thing. Chapter VIII argues that Humean empiricism could, in principle, provide a satisfactory analysis of modality in terms of pragmatic considerations concerning our choice of descriptive predicates, but that attempts to maintain the so-called "thesis of extensionality" have prevented such a program from being carried out. Chapter IX recapitulates the previous arguments, restating the criticisms which have been made of the philosophical positions examined in terms of problems concerning internal and external relations. These criticisms are then shown to be subsumable under certain general criticisms of attempts to reduce external relations to internal relations, or vice versa. It con­cludes with suggestions concerning fruitful approaches to a solution of the problem of the status of indeterminacy.},

@article{Kauffman2009,
abstract = {Purpose: The paper discusses the concept of a reflexive domain, an arena where the apparent objects as entities of the domain are actually processes and transformations of the domain as a whole. Human actions in the world partake of the patterns of reflexivity, and the productions of human beings, including science and mathematics, can be seen in this light. Methodology: Simple mathematical models are used to make conceptual points. Context: The paper begins with a review of the author’s previous work on eigenforms - objects as tokens for eigenbehaviors, the study of recursions and fixed points of recursions. The paper also studies eigenforms in the Boolean reflexive models of Vladimir Lefebvre. Findings: The paper gives a mathematical definition of a reflexive domain and proves that every transformation of such a domain has a fixed point. (This point of view has been taken by William Lawvere in the context of logic and category theory.) Thus eigenforms exist in reflexive domains. We discuss a related concept called a “magma.” A magma is composed entirely of its own structure-preserving transformations. Thus a magma can be regarded as a model of reflexivity and we call a magma “reflexive” if it encompasses all of its structure-preserving transformations (plus a side condition explained in the paper). We prove a fixed point theorem for reflexive magmas. We then show how magmas are related to knot theory and to an extension of set theory using knot diagrammatic topology. This work brings formalisms for self-reference into a wider arena of process algebra, combinatorics, non-standard set theory and topology. The paper then discusses how these findings are related to lambda calculus, set theory and models for self-reference. The last section of the paper is an account of a computer experiment with a variant of the Life cellular automaton of John H. Conway. In this variant, 7-Life, the recursions lead to self-sustaining processes with very long evolutionary patterns. We show how examples of novel phenomena arise in these patterns over the course of large time scales. Value: The paper provides a wider context and mathematical conceptual tools for the cybernetic study of reflexivity and circularity in systems.},

abstract = {The goal of this book is to present classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics in an almost completely algebraic setting, thereby introducing mathematicians, physicists, and engineers to the ideas relating classical and quantum mechanics with Lie algebras and Lie groups. The book emphasizes the closeness of classical and quantum mechanics, and the material is selected in a way to make this closeness as apparent as possible. Much of the material covered here is not part of standard textbook treatments of classical or quantum mechanics (or is only superficially treated there). For physics students who want to get a broader view of the subject, this book may therefore serve as a useful complement to standard treatments of quantum mechanics. Almost without exception, this book is about precise concepts and exact results in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics. The structural properties of mechanics are discussed independent of computational techniques for obtaining quantitatively correct numbers from the assumptions made. The standard approximation machinery for calculating from first principles explicit thermodynamic properties of materials, or explicit cross sections for high energy experiments can be found in many textbooks and is not repeated here.},

@article{Doering2008,
abstract = {The goal of this paper is to summarise the first steps in developing a fundamentally new way of constructing theories of physics. The motivation comes from a desire to address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating quantum theories of space and time. In doing so we provide a new answer to Heidegger's timeless question ``What is a thing?''. Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of physics is equivalent to finding a representation in a topos of a certain formal language that is attached to the system. Classical physics uses the topos of sets. Other theories involve a different topos. For the types of theory discussed in this paper, a key goal is to represent any physical quantity \$A\$ with an arrow \$\backslash breve\{A\}\_\backslash phi:\backslash Si\_\backslash phi\backslash map\backslash R\_\backslash phi\$ where \$\backslash Si\_\backslash phi\$ and \$\backslash R\_\backslash phi\$ are two special objects (the `state-object' and `quantity-value object') in the appropriate topos, \$\backslash tau\_\backslash phi\$. We discuss two different types of language that can be attached to a system, \$S\$. The first, \$\backslash PL\{S\}\$, is a propositional language; the second, \$\backslash L\{S\}\$, is a higher-order, typed language. Both languages provide deductive systems with an intuitionistic logic. With the aid of \$\backslash PL\{S\}\$ we expand and develop some of the earlier work (By CJI and collaborators.) on topos theory and quantum physics. A key step is a process we term `daseinisation' by which a projection operator is mapped to a sub-object of the spectral presheaf \$\backslash Sig\$--the topos quantum analogue of a classical state space. The topos concerned is \$\backslash SetH\{\}\$: the category of contravariant set-valued functors on the category (partially ordered set) \$\backslash V\{\}\$ of commutative sub-algebras of the algebra of bounded operators on the quantum Hilbert space \$\backslash Hi\$.},

abstract = {The structure determination of voltage-gated channels by the combination of molecular modeling and mutagenesis experiments is a long term, iterative process. As such, the models should be considered as a work in progress, with changes expected as more data becomes available. The primary role of the models is that they assimilate the known data and provide ideas for further experiments to elucidate the real structures. Although the models presented here have already gone through two or three cycles of development and testing, many aspects remain tentative. Perhaps the most significant result so far is that the P segment was experimentally confirmed to form the ion-selective part of the channel. In a subsequent cycle of testing and modeling, the specific residues responsibility for Na+ and Ca2+ selectivity have been identified and the selectivity filter of K+ channels is now predicted to be formed by the side chains, but rather by the carbonyl oxygens of the conserved Gly-Tyr-Gly sequence backbone. As another example, the 9p residue of the P segment of K+ channels was originally modeled as either being buried in the protein or accessible channels was originally modeled as either being buried in the protein or accessible from inside the cell only. However, once mutation of this residue to histidine was found to affect blockade by extracellular TEA, protons, Zn2+ and histidine reagents (DeBiasi et al., 1993), the models were updated to have this and the hydrophilic residues in the first part of P form a helix that comprises part of the extracellular, outer vestibular of the pore. While this motif was used also for Na+ and Ca2+ pore models (see Fig. 2) where the putative helices are amphipathic, it remains to be verified. Modeling of the size and shape of the outer vestibule of K+ channels was also aided by the data for the binding of CTX in the extracellular entrance to the pore. Similarly, experiments with peptide toxins such as mu and omega conotoxins may prove useful in modeling the outer vestibules of the Na+ and/or Ca2+ channels. While important advances have been made, it is important to realize that these approaches are still very new. In the future we are likely to see improvements on both the theoretical and experimental sides which will greatly advance the process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) References: 46},

abstract = {Extreme environments are closely associated with phenotypic evolution, yet the mechanisms behind this relationship are poorly understood. Several themes and approaches in recent studies significantly further our understanding of the importance that stress-induced variation plays in evolution. First, stressful environments modify (and often reduce) the integration of neuroendocrinological, morphological and behavioural regulatory systems. Second, such reduced integration and subsequent accommodation of stress-induced variation by developmental systems enables organismal 'memory' of a stressful event as well as phenotypic and genetic assimilation of the response to a stressor. Third, in complex functional systems, a stress-induced increase in phenotypic and genetic variance is often directional, channelled by existing ontogenetic pathways. This accounts for similarity among individuals in stress-induced changes and thus significantly facilitates the rate of adaptive evolution. Fourth, accumulation of phenotypically neutral genetic variation might be a common property of locally adapted and complex organismal systems, and extreme environments facilitate the phenotypic expression of this variance. Finally, stress-induced effects and stress-resistance strategies often persist for several generations through maternal, ecological and cultural inheritance. These transgenerational effects, along with both the complexity of developmental systems and stressor recurrence, might facilitate genetic assimilation of stress-induced effects. Accumulation of phenotypically neutral genetic variance by developmental systems and phenotypic accommodation of stress-induced effects, together with the inheritance of stress-induced modifications, ensure the evolutionary persistence of stress-response strategies and provide a link between individual adaptability and evolutionary adaptation.},

abstract = {With official genomic blueprints now available for hundreds of species, and thousands more expected in the near future, the field of biology has been forever transformed. Such readily accessible data have encouraged the proliferation of adaptive arguments for the evolution of gene and genomic features, often with little or no attention being given to simpler and more powerful alternative explanations. By integrating the central observations from molecular biology and population genetics relevant to comparative genomics, Lynch shows why the details matter. Presented in a nontechnical fashion, at both the population-genetic and molecular-genetic levels, this book offers a unifying explanatory framework for how the peculiar architectural diversity of eukaryotic genomes and genes came to arise. Under Lynch's hypothesis, the genome-wide repatterning of eukaryotic gene structure, which resulted primarily from nonadaptive processes, provided an entirely novel resource from which natural selection could secondarily build new forms of organismal complexity.},

The papers of this volume thus display a wide panorama of connections of polytope theory with other fields.

abstract = {Within recent years interest in nonlinear equations has grown enormously. They are extremely important as basic equations in many areas of mathematical physics, and they have received renewed attention because of progress in their solution by machines. This volume undertakes a definition of the field, indicating advances that have been made up through 1960. The author's position is that while the advent of machines has resulted in much new knowledge, one should not disregard analytical methods, since the solution of nonlinear equations possesses singularities which only the analytical method (as based upon the work of Poincare, Liapounoff, Painleve and Goursatl can discover. After a general survey of the problem presented by nonlinear equations, the author discusses the differential equation of the first order, following this by chapters on the Riccati equation (as a bridge between linear and nonlinear equations) and existence theorems, with special reference to Cauchy's method. Second order equations are introduced via Volterra's problem and the problem of pursuit, and succeeding chapters cover elliptic integrals and functions and theta functions; differential equations of the second order; and second order differential equations of the polynomial class, with special reference to Painleve transcendents. The technique of continuous analytical continuation is shown, while phenomena of the phase plane are studied as an introduction to nonlinear mechanics. Nonlinear 111echanics is then discussed, with various classical equations like Van der Pol's equations, Emden's equation, and the Duffing problem. The remaining chapters are concerned with nonlinear integral equations, problems from the calculus of variations, and numerical integration of nonlinear equations. Throughout the book the results of distinguished analysis of the past and modern machine computations are both taken into account. Despite the thoroughness of its coverage this is a very fine introduction to this important area of mathematics, and it can easily be followed by the mathematically sophisticated reader who knows very little about nonlinear equations.},

abstract = {Matrix-analytic and related methods have become recognized as an important and fundamental approach for the mathematical analysis of general classes of complex stochastic models. Research in the area of matrix-analytic and related methods seeks to discover underlying probabilistic structures intrinsic in such stochastic models, develop numerical algorithms for computing functionals (e.g., performance measures) of the underlying stochastic processes, and apply these probabilistic structures and/or computational algorithms within a wide variety of fields. This volume presents recent research results on: the theory, algorithms and methodologies concerning matrix-analytic and related methods in stochastic models; and the application of matrix-analytic and related methods in various fields, which includes but is not limited to computer science and engineering, communication networks and telephony, electrical and industrial engineering, operations research, management science, financial and risk analysis, and bio-statistics. These research studies provide deep insights and understanding of the stochastic models of interest from a mathematics and/or applications perspective, as well as identify directions for future research.},

@book{Wagner2013,
abstract = {All living things are remarkably complex, yet their DNA is unstable, undergoing countless random mutations over generations. Despite this instability, most animals do not grow two heads or die, plants continue to thrive, and bacteria continue to divide. Robustness and Evolvability in Living Systems tackles this perplexing paradox. The book explores why genetic changes do not cause organisms to fail catastrophically and how evolution shapes organisms' robustness. Andreas Wagner looks at this problem from the ground up, starting with the alphabet of DNA, the genetic code, RNA, and protein molecules, moving on to genetic networks and embryonic development, and working his way up to whole organisms. He then develops an evolutionary explanation for robustness. Wagner shows how evolution by natural selection preferentially finds and favors robust solutions to the problems organisms face in surviving and reproducing. Such robustness, he argues, also enhances the potential for future evolutionary innovation. Wagner also argues that robustness has less to do with organisms having plenty of spare parts (the redundancy theory that has been popular) and more to do with the reality that mutations can change organisms in ways that do not substantively affect their fitness. Unparalleled in its field, this book offers the most detailed analysis available of all facets of robustness within organisms. It will appeal not only to biologists but also to engineers interested in the design of robust systems and to social scientists concerned with robustness in human communities and populations.},

@article{Price1972e,
abstract = {It has long been a mystery how Fisher (1930, 1941, 1958) derived his famous ‘fundamental theorem of Natural Selection’ and exactly what he meant by it. He stated the theorem in these words (1930, p. 35; 1958, p. 37): ‘The rate of increase inJitness of any organism at any time is equal to its genetic variance injtness at that time.’ And also in these words (1930, p. 46; 1958, p. 50): ‘The rate of increase of fitness of any species is equal to the genetic variance in fitness.’ He compared this result to the second law of thermodynamics, and described it as holding ‘the supreme position among the biological sciences’. Also, he spoke of the ‘rigour’ of his derivation of the theorem and of ‘the ease of its interpretation’. But others have variously described his derivation as ‘recondite’ (Crow \& Kimura, 1970), ‘very difficult’ (Turner, 1970), or ‘entirely obscure’ (Kempthorne, 1957). And no one has ever found any other way to derive the result that Fisher seems to state. Hence, many authors (not reviewed here) have maintained that the theorem holds only under very special conditions, while only a few (eg. Edwards, 1967) have thought that Fisher may have been correct -- if only we could understand what he meant ! It will be shown here that this latter view is correct. Fisher’s theorem does indeed hold with the generality that he claimed for it. The mystery and the controversy result from incompre- hensibility rather than error. 2.},
